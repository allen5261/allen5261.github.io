中科院神经科学研究所研究员孙强团队24日下午在北京宣布，团队经过5年的不懈努力，突破了体细胞克隆猴的世界难题，成功培育出世界首个体细胞克隆猴。这标志着中国将率先开启以猕猴作为实验动物模型的时代。该项成果于1月25日以封面文章在线发表在生物学顶尖学术期刊《细胞》上。

2017年11月27日，世界上首个体细胞克隆猴“中中”在中科院神经科学研究所诞生；12月5日，第二个克隆猴“华华”诞生。两只克隆猴均为雌性。截至目前，两只小猴子的各项身体指标均很正常，发育状态良好。

自从1997年“多莉羊”体细胞克隆成功后，许多哺乳动物的体细胞克隆也相继成功，但与人类相近的非人灵长类动物（猕猴）的体细胞克隆一直是没有解决的难题。

用普通的猴子做实验动物模型，存在两个劣势：“一是猴子的繁殖力低，传代时间长。二是遗传背景复杂，这样个体差异大，对实验干扰就会比较大。”孙强说。

谈到体细胞克隆猴构建成功的意义，蒲慕明表示，首先证实了猕猴可以用体细胞来克隆，二是猕猴可以成为真正有用的动物模型。“克隆猴遗传背景相同，就减少个体间差异对实验的干扰，大大减少了实验动物使用数量。同时，通过体细胞克隆技术，模型猴制备时间缩短到一年内，复杂和精准的基因编辑可以在体外培养的细胞进行。”蒲慕明说。

In Beijing on the afternoon of January 24, a researcher in _Neurosciences Institute of Chinese Academy of Sciences_(中科院神经科学研究所), Sun Qiang with his group declared that with 5 years' endeavors, they had solved the worldwide problem of _primate_(灵长类) cloning by _somatic cell nuclear_(体细胞), they had successfully cloned the first monkey made by somatic cell nuclear transfer yesterday. This marks that China will be the first to use _macaques_(猕猴) as an experimental animal model. The milestone was published online on Jan. 25 in the _Cell_ magazine, a leading biology magazine.

On November 27, 2017, the world's first somatic cell nuclear cloning monkey, Zhong Zhong was born in the Neurosciences Institute of Chinese Academy of Sciences. On December 5, the second cloned monkey, Hua Hua born. Both monkeys are female. So far, the two young monkeys' _physical conditions_(身体指标) are normal and they grow well.

After the success of the somatic cell cloning sheep Dolly in 1997, many _mammalians_(哺乳动物) have been successfully cloned by somatic cell one after another, but the problem of cloning primates by somatic cell nuclear was never solved.

There are two disadvantages of using ordinary monkeys as experimental animal models: "First, the monkeys have low _fertility_(繁殖力) and their _breeding time_(传代期) is long. Second, the _genetic_(遗传的) background is complex, such _individual_(个体) difference is big, the interference to the experiment will be bigger." Sun Qiang said.

When Sun mentioned the _significance_(意义) of the success of somatic cell cloning monkeys, he said, "first of all, it proved the monkeys can be cloned by somatic cells, the second is that macaques can truly become useful animal models. " "The genetic background of the clone monkeys are same, which avoid the difference between the individual _interference_(干扰) with experiment, greatly reduced the number of experimental animals use. At the same time, with the somatic cell cloning technology,  preparation time of model monkey shortened to a year, complicated and precise gene editing can carry out by culture in vitro." says Mu-ming Poo.
